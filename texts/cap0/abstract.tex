This is an example of an abstract.

An abstract summarizes the dissertation or thesis. Usually, It is one or two pages long. It describes the problem, motivates its solution and presents the proposed approach. An abstract must also describe the results obtained, and the whole text must be written in such a way that the reader can clearly identify what the thesis or dissertation is about, what is the proposed approach, and which results were obtained. The text style is formal and must avoid both self-contempt and self-acknowledgement. References should be avoided. The author must keep in mind that the abstract is probably the first part of the thesis or dissertation that any reader will read.
